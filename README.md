This repo contains the tools used to manage and inform about the LOL opening status.

LOL is the Lyon Open Lab hackerspace from Lyon, France.

You'll find the IRC bot [there](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/tree/master/irc).


The APIs in this development should try to respect, as possible, the spaceAPI specifications (http://spaceapi.net/).
