=========

This repo contains the tools used to manage and inform about the LOL opening status.

LOL is the Lyon Open Lab hackerspace from Lyon, France.

You can find the Linux Kernel module that provides non-root access to the Raspberry PI GPIOs [there](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/tree/master/lol_gpio).

[There](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/tree/master/irc) is the IRC bot.


The APIs in this development should try to respect, as possible, the spaceAPI specifications (http://spaceapi.net/).
