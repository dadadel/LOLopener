LOLopener
=========

This repo contains the tools used to manage and inform about the LOL opening status.

LOL is the Lyon Open Lab hackerspace from Lyon, France.

You can find the Linux Kernel module that provides non-root access to the Raspberry PI GPIOs of the project [there](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/tree/master/lol_gpio).

The tools for getting status, announcing on IRC, mailing are [there](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/tree/master/lolopener), and the management is done [in that script](https://github.com/dadadel/LOLopener/blob/master/lolopener.py).


The APIs in this development should try to respect, as possible, the spaceAPI specifications (http://spaceapi.net/).
